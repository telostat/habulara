  This is a simple example that consumes a CSV with following fields:

  1. **id:** ID of the weather station
  2. **code:** Alphanumeric code of the weather station
  3. **temp:** Temperature measured at the weather station, in degree Celcius
  4. **prec:** Probability of precipitation anticipated at the weather station as a number between 0 and 1.

  ... and produces a CSV with following fields:

  1. **wsid:** ID of the weather station (same as **id** in the original input)
  2. **code:** Alphanumeric code of the weather station (no operation is defined, ie. pass-through)
  3. **temperatureC:** Temperature measured at the weather station, in degree Celcius
  4. **temperatureF:** Temperature measured at the weather station, in degree Fahrenheit
  5. **precipitation:** Probability of precipitation anticipated at the weather station in percentage points.

  ... whereby

  - both **temperatureF** and **precipitation** are computed values, and **temperatureC** is a type-guarded value.
